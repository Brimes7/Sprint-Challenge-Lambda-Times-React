1.What are PropTypes used for? Please describe why it's important to type check our data in JavaScript.

PropTypes are used in react to allow communication from one component to the other. They are specifically used when bigger projects are being worked on.

Type checking simply prevents errors in the code much like debugging.

2.Describe a life-cycle event in React?

It can be broken down in 3 steps. The render would count as the first step. Then the contructor is mounted and then you would proceed to use the constructorDidMount() to complete the full life cycle.

3.Explain the details of a Higher Order Component?

I really don't want to...but the best way to explain it is the component takes in one or multiple components as an argument then it returns a brand new component. The return is typically a carbon copy of what was originally passed through but with add functionalities.

4.What are three different ways to style components in React? Explain some of the benefits of each.

You can use CSS in JS, Styled Components or even CSS Modules.
